🌿 What to Build First (MVP)
Start with your core loop: “I live in this area → what can I grow right now?”
Your MVP should answer that question and make it delightful.
Step 1. 📍 Location Input + Seasonality Output
Build:
Page with location input (zip code or city)
Show a list of vegetables that are in season or ready to plant there right now
Each plant: name, emoji/icon, planting/harvest window, basic notes
Stretch:
Add filters like “easy to grow”, “great for kids”, or “container gardening”
Let people "favorite" plants
Step 2. 🧠 Data Layer
You’ll need seasonal planting data by region. Start rough:
Use USDA Plant Hardiness Zones as regions
Hardcode a JSON file like:
{
  "zone_6b": {
    "June": ["Zucchini", "Carrots"],
    "July": ["Tomatoes", "Peppers"]
  }
}
Eventually, expand this into a real database.
Step 3. 🪴 The Garden (Optional/Next Phase)
Once the lookup experience is smooth, add a gamified element:
Let users “plant” things in a virtual garden
Add timers/growth phases
Let them log what they actually grew
But you don’t need this yet. Your MVP can just be: show me what’s in season in my area.
🧪 Bonus Tips
If you want to fake the full app feeling: use Next.js (React-based, gives routing and SSR if you ever need it).
For now, mock auth and user accounts. Don't touch logins unless you're ready.
Use your design sense — seasonal colors, soft UI, plant emojis. Make it a little magical.
TL;DR
Stack: React + Tailwind + JSON data → maybe Firebase/Supabase later
Build first: A seasonal lookup experience based on region
Goal: Teach + delight — don’t over-engineer it at first
